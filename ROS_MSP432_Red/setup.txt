1. This repository is setup to be used with Code Composer Studio 8.30 "CCSV8" under Ubuntu 16.04.  The following directories were used in CCSV8 and need to be changed based on your home directory/environment.  The directorys are ti's Simplelink driver libray, and a version of the ros library for ti devices.

2. The ccsv8 installation directory that was used was: /opt/ti/ccsv8

3. The ti driver library was installed in ny home directory as: ~/ti/simplelink_msp432p4_sdk_2_20_00_12

4. The workspace name used was: ~/MicroControllers/ROS_MSP432_Red
   The ros libary used was:     ~/ti/RosLib

5. The following linked resources need to be added to your workspace as follows:
	Window->Preferences->General->Workspace->Linked Resources->Edit
	Note: Path must be absolute, replace xxxuser

	Select and Edit these variables, replacing "pops" with your "username"
	
	Ros MSP432, variables
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	ROS_LIB			/opt/ros/kinetic/include
	ROS_TI_LIB		/home/xxxx/ti/RosLib
	ROS_MSP_HWD_LIB 	/home/xxxx/MicroControllers/ROS_MSP432_Red/RosMspHwdLib/Debug
	ROS_MSP_HWD_SRC 	/home/xxxx/MicroControllers/ROS_MSP432_Red/RosMspHwdLib/src
	SIMPLELINK		/home/xxxx/ti/simplelink_msp432p4_sdk_2_20_00_12/source
	MSP432_DRIVERLIB_LIB	/home/xxxx/ti/simplelink_msp432p4_sdk_2_20_00_12/source/ti/devices/msp432p4xx/driverlib/ccs
	MSP432_DRIVERLIB_SRC	/home/xxxx/ti/simplelink_msp432p4_sdk_2_20_00_12/source/ti/devices/msp432p4xx/driverlib

6. For the "RosMspHwdLib" project update the include files to reflect your environmental variables as follows:
	RosMspHardware->Properites->ARM Compiler->Include Options
	Variables:	SIMPLELINK, ROS_TI_LIB, ROS_MSP_HWD_SRC, MSP432_DRIVERLIB_SRC
	RosMspHardware->Properites->ARM Compiler->Predefined Symbols
	Pre-Define NAME: LED_HEARTBEAT, LED_RX_LINK, LED_TX_BLINK, __MSP432P401R__ <- maybe different for you

7. Repeat the basic process as in step 6 but add other include files, example:
	PublisherHelloWorld->Properties->MSP432 Compiler->Include Options
	Variables:	SIMPLELINK, ROS_TI_LIB, ROS_MSP_HWD_SRC
	Symbols:	__MSP432P401R__ <- maybe different for you

8. The linker paths need to be set as follows:
	PublisherHelloWorld->Properties->MSP432 LINKER->File Search Path:
	Variables: 	MSP432_DRIVERLIB_LIB, ROS_MSP_HWD_LIB
	Library files:	msp432p4xx_driverlib.lib, RosMspHwdLib.lib
